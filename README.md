# 🎧 Sound Engineering Projects

This repository contains selected academic works completed during my studies in the **Sound Engineering** program at the **National University of Tres de Febrero (UNTREF)**, Argentina.

Some of these reports were originally written in English, while others have been translated from Spanish using DeepL and lightly edited for clarity.

Projects are organized by theme and cover areas such as **room acoustics**, **electroacoustic design**, **sound measurements**, and **psychoacoustic analysis**.
